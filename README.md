# Exploring the Australian Curriculum

The [Australian Curriculum](https://australiancurriculum.edu.au/) specifies what Australian students from the Foundation year to Year 10 should be taught. It is a complex set of information shared via a fairly usable website. To truly understand and leverage the Australian Curriculum teachers and schools need to integrate its content into their daily activity. Not a straight forward process.

This project has three initial goals:

1. Explore how the Australian Curriculum can be made more [generative](https://djplaner.github.io/memex/sense/nodt/generativity/).
2. Offer a purposeful reason to explore different [Python](https://www.python.org/) based technologies in service of that goal.
3. Explore various useful applications of a generative Australian Curriculum to teachers and schools.
