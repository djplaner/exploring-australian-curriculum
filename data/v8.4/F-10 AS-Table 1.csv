They use key grammatical forms and structures in spoken and written texts, such as articles, nouns, adjectives, personal pronouns, verbs and verb tenses, conjunctions, adverbs (for example, ال التعريف البيت؛ المدرسة؛ الدراسة؛ العائلة؛ المواد الدراسية؛الهوايات  كبير/كبيرة؛ طويل/طويلة؛ ممتع/ممتعة؛ مفيد/مفيدة؛ مدرستي كبيرة؛ عائلتي صغيرة؛ بيتي واسع؛ شارعنا ضيق؛, أنتَ؛ أنتِ؛ أنتم؛ هو؛ هي؛ هم؛  أذهب إلى المدرسة؛ نذهب إلى السينما؛ ذهبت إلى السينما؛ ذهبنا إلى زيارة الأقارب  و؛ أو؛ كذلك؛ أيضاً؛ لأنّ  يوميا؛ غالبا؛ أحيانا؛ بكيت بشدّة؛ تكلمت بحماسٍ؛ إستيقضت متأخراً؛ وصلت إلى المسرح باكراً ),They apply writing conventions to written texts, such as لا أستطيع أن أكمل البحث؛ لم أستطع أن أجيب على جميع أسئلة الإمتحان أين تتمرن لكرة القدم؟ متى تلعب الرياضة؟ ما هي مادتك المفضلة؟ كم شخص يوجد في عائلتك؟ إستخدام العنوان؛ الفقرات؛ الفواصل؛ أدوات الترقيم؛ التوقيع في خاتمة الرسالة. They use contextual cues and textual features to translate and interpret everyday texts from Arabic into English and vice versa, and identify similarities and differences in translation. They create texts in Arabic and English, identifying words and expressions that do not readily translate, such as بالهناء والشفاء؛ والله ولي التوفيق. They compare ways of communicating in Arabic and English and explain how their own biography influences their cultural identity and ways of communicating.
      Students identify and apply the writing conventions of the Arabic alphabet and script, making connections between spoken and written Arabic in texts. They identify the structure and features of different personal, informative and imaginative texts and provide simple explanations as to how these elements contribute to meaning. They identify ways in which spoken Arabic varies according to regions and countries, and provide examples of how Arabic has changed over time due to influences from other languages and cultures. Students identify how written Arabic varies in style and in the use of formal and informal forms, for example, أنتَ/حضرتكَ/حضرتكم, according to context, situation and the relationship between participants. They identify ways in which language use reflects cultural ideas, thoughts and perceptions.

Arabic,Arabic,,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"
      By the end of Year 10, students use written and spoken Arabic to initiate and sustain interactions with peers and adults. They use language spontaneously to exchange ideas, opinions and feelings, compare experiences and discuss future plans. They sustain interactions by asking and responding to questions, requesting clarification (for example,  هل تعني....؟ ما قصدك؟), elaborating on opinions, and expressing agreement or disagreement, for example, على أتفق؟ لا أتفق؛ أعترض. In classroom interactions, they share ideas and suggestions, negotiate options, solve problems and complete transactions. They apply pronunciation and intonation rules to convey emotions and enhance expression. They obtain information from multiple sources on a range of issues and analyse and evaluate meaning, gist and purpose. They convey ideas and viewpoints from a range of perspectives using different text types and modes of presentation selected to suit different audiences and to achieve different purposes. They share their responses to different imaginative texts by expressing opinions on themes, events and values and explaining key ideas and messages. They manipulate language and use different techniques to produce imaginative texts in a range of forms that draw on past experiences or future possibilities, such as التلاعب بالألفاظ بواسطة إستخدام المفردات ذات المعاني المزدوجة؛ إستخدام عبارات مثل ليتني كنت...؛ فرحت فرحاً عظيماً؛ لو ربحت المسابقة. When creating texts, students use a variety of grammatical elements, such as conditional and subjunctive moods, embedded clauses and imperative forms (for example, لو سمح أبي لي ٍآتي معك  ما نذهب إلى السينما يوم السبت ؛ قد أسافر في العطلة؛الكتاب المفضل لدي والذي أحبه كثيرا هو ... لنذهب إلى المعلم ونسأله؛ هيا حاول مرة ثانية؛ ممتاز! أحسنت؛ تكلم مع سامر ), future tense and vocative case to convey meaning. They use vocabulary and expressions that are culturally embedded, such as سوف أكتب رسالة إلى المدير أعبر فيها عن رأيي؛ يا سمير هل أشتريت الجيتار الذي رأيته في المحل؟ , and apply appropriate writing conventions to increase text cohesion and enhance expression. Students translate and interpret texts from Arabic into English and vice versa, comparing own interpretations with others’ and explaining reasons for differences in translations. Students create bilingual texts for the wider community, interpreting cultural and linguistic aspects of texts. They explain how cultural concepts, practices and values influence ways in which they communicate from a bilingual perspective, and question assumptions and describe adjustments they make when moving from Arabic to English and vice versa.
      Students identify the meaning and emotions conveyed in spoken texts, such as .ها سمير ماذا قررت؟؛ لا لا ؛ لا أقصد هذا؛ كم مرة قلت لك .. , and apply their understanding of the Arabic writing system to enhance meaning and aesthetic effect in written texts. They analyse the relationship between language choices and textual features, and the audience, purpose and context of different spoken, written and multimodal texts. Students explain how spoken and written forms of Arabic vary according to context, purpose and audience, and identify ways in which the Arabic language influences and is influenced by cultural, political and social change. They explain the power of language in determining the nature of intercultural communication in local and global contexts.

They know that languages change over time and influence each other. They identify French words used in English (such as menu, mousse) and English words used in French (such as le weekend, stop!). They demonstrate understanding of the fact that language may need to be adjusted to suit different situations and relationships (for example, formal and informal language, different text types). They explain how French has its own rules for pronunciation, non-verbal communication and grammar. They use terms such as verb, adjective and gender for talking about language and learning. Students identify ways in which languages are connected with cultures, and how the French language, like their own, reflects ways of behaving and thinking as well as ways of using language."

They communicate their thoughts with awareness of different perspectives on issues or practices being discussed. They explain how Italian language use varies according to context, purpose and mode. They identify social and cultural practices of Italians in Italy and in the diaspora, including communities in Australia. They identify particular issues relating to translating between Italian and English, such as words with similar meanings and 'false friends, and identify certain concepts that cannot be translated readily from Italian to English and from English into Italian. They reflect on ways in which language and culture together create meanings, and on ways in which their own linguistic and cultural assumptions come into play in using and learning Italian. They demonstrate understanding of the role of language and culture in shaping experience, and the ways in which their own past experiences shape their identity."
Japanese,Japanese,,Years F–10 Sequence,Foundation to Year 2,"
      By the end of Year 2, students interact with the teacher and peers through play- and action-related language. They use formulaic expressions and appropriate gestures in everyday interactions such as exchanging greetings and farewells, for example, おはようございます、おはよう、こんにちは、さようなら、また、あした, thanking and apologising, and giving and receiving, for example, どうぞ、どうも. They use visual, non-verbal and contextual support such as pictures, gestures, facial expressions and props to make meaning of simple texts. When listening to simple repetitive spoken texts, they identify key words such as names or numbers of objects or people, and demonstrate comprehension by actions, drawing or labelling. They respond to instructions through actions, for example, きいて　ください。みて　ください 。, and respond to questions, for example, だれなに どこ with single words and set phrases and by selecting images or objects, for example, いぬ　です　か。ねこ　です　か 。. They present information about themselves, their family, friends and favourite things at word and simple sentence level, using formulaic and modelled language. They describe people and objects using adjectives to indicate colour, shape and size, for example, あかい　りんご、おおきい、まるい. They indicate ownership by using, for example, だれ　の　ですか。わたし/ぼく　の　です。 They mimic Japanese pronunciation, intonation and rhythm through shared reading and singing. Students recognise and begin to write single kanji, such as 人, 木, 山、川、月、日、一、ニ、三, the 46 hiragana symbols, and some hiragana words such as くち、ねこ、あお、しかく. They demonstrate understanding of hiragana as well as kanji by actions such as matching, labelling and sorting. They translate and interpret examples of everyday Japanese language use and cultural behaviours such as the exchange of greetings or thanks, terms of address and some formulaic expressions and behaviours.
      Students identify the three different scripts in Japanese, hiragana, kanji and katakana. They understand that hiragana represents the basic units of Japanese sound and apply that knowledge in their communication. They know that kanji represents meaning as well as sounds, and that katakana is used for borrowed words. They know that stroke order in writing characters is important. Students identify patterns in Japanese words and phrases and make comparisons between Japanese and English, for example, the word order in greetings, such as Smith せんせい、and in simple sentences, such as おりがみ　が　すきです。ぞう　は　おおきい　です。. They provide examples of different ways of addressing friends, family and teachers or other adults. They use pronouns, such as わたし/ぼく, and titles/suffixes, such as ～せんせい/～さん/～くん, to address different people. They identify Japanese words that are often used in English-speaking contexts, for example, ‘sushi’, ‘origami’ and ‘karate’. They give examples of Japanese words and phrases that have been borrowed from other languages, such as ピンク、テレビ、パン. They identify similarities and differences between Japanese and their own languages and cultures.
    "
Japanese,Japanese,,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 3 and 4,"
      By the end of Year 4, students interact with the teacher and peers in regular classroom routines and structured interactions. They understand and respond to instructions related to classroom organisation and activities, for example, ペア　に　なって　ください。大きい　こえ　で　いって　ください。. They use formulaic and rehearsed language to exchange information about their personal worlds and in familiar interactions such as praising or encouraging one another, for example, 
      
        がんばって. They use language spontaneously in simple familiar communicative exchanges, for example, やったー！だいじょうぶ？. They respond to simple questions using short spoken statements, for example, いつ　です　か。なに　が　すき　です　か。. They use counter classifiers in response to questions such as なん人(にん)、なん月(がつ)、なんじ、なんさい. Students identify specific items of information, such as facts about or key characteristics of people, when listening to or viewing texts such as short stories, weather reports or video clips. They use cues such as context, visual images and familiar vocabulary to assist comprehension. They create short spoken informative and descriptive texts related to their personal world with the support of modelled language, scaffolded examples and resources such as word lists. They describe people and events using adjectives, time-related vocabulary and appropriate verb forms, such as ます、ましょう、ました and ません. They read and write the 46 hiragana, including long vowels (for example, おとうさん、おおきい), voiced sounds (for example, かぞく、たべます), and blended sounds as formulaic language (for example, きょう、でしょう), as well as high-frequency kanji such as 月、日、先生. They apply word order (subject–object–verb) in simple sentences. They comprehend short written texts such as captions, labels, signs and stories that use familiar and repetitive language. They translate simple texts using classroom resources such as charts or word lists, noticing that some words and expressions do not translate easily. Students identify examples of cultural differences between ways of communicating in Japanese and in their own language(s). 
      Students identify both vowel and vowel–consonant sounds of hiragana, recognising that vowel sounds can be elongated and that this can change meaning. They identify ways in which rhythm is used to chunk phrases within a sentence. Students use the hiragana chart to support their reading and writing, recognising its systematic nature. They demonstrate awareness of the predictable nature of pronunciation. They know the role of particles, for example, は、を、と、も、に; the rules for simple verb tense conjugations; and how to create questions using the sentence-ending particle か. They understand and use the rules and phonetic changes that apply to counter classifiers, for example, はっさい、ひとり、ふたり. They identify language variations that occur according to the age and relationship of participants, and according to the situation, for example, なまえ/ おなまえ、はし/ おはし. They demonstrate their understanding of the importance in Japanese of non-verbal communication such as the use of gestures, for example, bowing to replace words and to communicate meaning. Students identify ways in which Japanese language reflects ways of behaving and thinking.
    "
Japanese,Japanese,,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 5 and 6,"
      By the end of Year 6, students use formulaic and modelled language in classroom interactions to carry out transactions and to share or convey information about daily routines, activities and events, using time expressions such as まい日、ときどき. They ask and respond to questions in familiar contexts using complete sentences and appropriate pronunciation, rhythm and intonation. They ask for clarification and assistance, negotiate turn-taking and follow instructions. They extend their answers by using conjunctions such as そして、それから. They show concern for and interest in others by making enquiries such as だいじょうぶ？, and apologise and express thanks using appropriate gestures. They read and write all hiragana, including voiced sounds, long vowel sounds, double consonants and blends, and high-frequency kanji, for example, 犬(いぬ), 小さい、雨(あめ). Students locate specific information and some supporting details in a range of spoken, written and multimodal texts on familiar topics. They express reactions to imaginative texts, such as by describing qualities of characters, for example, やさしい　人　です。. They create connected texts of a few sentences, such as descriptions, dialogues or skits. They structure sentences using particles, for example, へ、で、を、がand prepositions, for example, の上(うえ)に, and apply the rules of punctuation when writing. They describe and recount events and experiences in time, for example, adjective です。noun です/でした。 and present/past/negative verb forms, for example, のみます、たべます、見(み)ました、いきません. They use counter classifiers in response to questions such as いくら　です　か。なんびき？なんこ？. Students translate familiar texts, recognising formulaic expressions and culturally specific textual features and language use. They comment on similarities and differences in ways of expressing values such as politeness, consideration and respect in Japanese compared to other languages and cultures.
      Students understand and use the hiragana chart to pronounce contracted and blended sounds and exceptions to phonetic rules, such as を、へ、は, and です. They understand and apply the rules and phonetic changes related to counter classifiers, such as さんぜんえん、いっこ、はっぴき. They apply their knowledge of stroke order to form characters. They give examples of ways in which languages both change over time and are influenced by other languages and cultures. They identify words from other languages used in Japanese, such as パソコン、メール、パスタ, and how the pronunciation, form and meaning of borrowed words can change when used in Japanese. Students identify behaviours and values associated with Japanese society and incorporate these into their own language use, such as ways of deflecting praise, for example, じょうず　です　ね。いいえ。.
    "
Japanese,Japanese,,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 7 and 8,"
      By the end of Year 8, students use Japanese to interact with peers, the teacher and others to exchange information, recount experiences and express opinions. They use verb ましょう for planning and making arrangements and offering suggestions. They ask and respond to a range of questions, for example, だれと、何(なん)で、いつ、どこで、using both rehearsed and some spontaneous language, giving opinions and making comparisons, for example, でも or が、わたしは　フットボールが　好きです。でも、母は　フットボールが　好きじゃないです。. Students apply rules of pronunciation, rhythm, stress and intonation to a range of sentence types and vocabulary, including double consonant and long vowel sounds and borrowed words. Students read and write hiragana, read katakana, and write familiar katakana words, including elongated vowels, double consonants and contractions. They read and write high-frequency kanji for verbs (for example, 行きます、見ます、来きます), nouns (for example, 先生、父、母、月よう日), adjectives (for example, 早い), and the pronoun 私. They read some compound words such as 日本語. They locate, analyse and summarise information from a range of spoken, written and multimodal texts, such as video clips, letters, posters, notices and advertisements. They plan, draft and present informative and imaginative texts with the support of modelled resources. They use counter classifiers in response to questions, for example, いくつ、何まい、何本、何分. They build cohesion in their texts and elaborate on meaning through the use of grammatical elements such as conjunctions (for example, だから), and adverbs of frequency (for example, いつも), time (for example, 時、半、分、前(まえ)) and direction, for example, みぎ、ひだり、前、うしろ. They use a variety of verb tenses to express ideas and experiences, and a range of particles, such as が、へ、から、まで、including for exampleに to indicate timeframes. Students translate and interpret short texts from Japanese into English and vice versa, providing alternative expressions when equivalence is not possible. They share their reactions to intercultural experiences, describing and explaining why some elements fit easily with their sense of their own identity while others do not.
      Students understand that the pronunciation of katakana is the same as that of hiragana, and that the pronunciation of borrowed words is influenced by the Japanese sound system. They apply appropriate word order in their spoken and written language, varying the order of noun phrases without altering the meaning. They understand and use いandなadjectives when appropriate, and apply the rules of phonetic change to counter classifiers, such as ひとつ、さんぼん、じゅっぷん. They identify and reproduce features of familiar text types such as emails, descriptions and dialogues. They identify words (for example, お母さんand 母), phrases (for example, どうぞよろしく。), prefixes (for example, お and ご), suffixes (for example, ～さん and ～さま) and titles (for example, ～先生) that indicate different levels of formality. They recognise values that are important in Japanese society, such as maintaining harmony and a sense of collective well-being, and how these are reflected through language and behaviours, such as indirect forms of refusal or disagreement, for example,もうすこしがんばりましょう。. They explain how cultural values and ideas are embedded in all languages and how their own communicative behaviour might be interpreted from other cultural perspectives.
    "
Japanese,Japanese,,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"
      By the end of Year 10, students use Japanese to share information, experiences and views related to their social worlds using rehearsed and spontaneous language. They use correct pronunciation, including that of borrowed words, and adopt appropriate rhythm and phrasing to allow for others’ use of あいづち. They ask and respond to questions, elaborating responses by providing reasons or explanations, using a range of adjectives and adverbs such as ぜんぜん or かなり. Students begin to use plain form to communicate with their peers. They use kanji to read and write verbs, for example, 思います、来ます、聞きます、食べます、飲(の)みます, nouns, for example, 新聞、会話(かいわ), 外国語(がいこくご) and adjectives, for example, 早い、上手な、下手(へた)な. Students extract, analyse and evaluate information from extended spoken, written and multimodal texts, such as films, blogs, brochures, itineraries and journals. They predict the meaning of unfamiliar words and expressions from context, grammatical knowledge and familiar kanji, and by drawing on their knowledge of textual characteristics and features. Students produce informative and imaginative texts, appropriate to audience and purpose, using the て form and plain form to express preferences, permission and prohibition and to describe past experiences. They build cohesion and complexity in written texts by using conjunctions, such as ですから、けれども, and indicate frequency by using a range of intensifiers, for example, よく、たいてい. Students discriminate appropriately in their use of kanji, hiragana and katakana. They translate and interpret texts, explaining words and expressions that are difficult to translate or that have embedded cultural meanings, such as にゅうがくしき、おぼん、サラリーマン. They discuss elements of interaction in Japanese, such as the importance and use of あいづち in meaning-making. They make connections and comparisons between their own and others’ culturally shaped perspectives, reflecting on the influence of perspectives on intercultural communication.
      Students understand the functions of the different scripts within text, for example, hiragana for grammatical elements; katakana for borrowed words and some onomatopoeia; and kanji for nouns, verbs, adjectives and some adverbs. They distinguish, for example, between おくりがな and ふりがな, and understand the concept of おん/くん readings. They identify multiple readings of kanji, and begin to use kanji radicals as a tool for indicating meaning. Students use the て form and plain form verbs as a basis for grammar conjugations. They use metalanguage to describe and compare language features and rules of sentence construction. Students choose です/ます or plain form based on age, relationship, familiarity and context. They identify hybrid terms that combine Japanese and English, such as コピペ、オーガナイズする、ダンスする. They explain how key Japanese cultural values such as community, 内(うち)/外(そと) and humility, いいえ、まだです。, and consideration of others are reflected in language and behaviours.
    "
Japanese,Japanese,,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 7 and 8,"
      By the end of Year 8, students interact with one another and the teacher in classroom routines and activities, exchanging greetings, wishes and information about their personal and social worlds. They use gestures and formulaic expressions appropriately, for example, おくれて すみません。しつれいします。 They comprehend and respond to familiar questions, such asだれ、 何(なに)、 どこ、 いつ、 何(なん)よう日(び)、 どんな、 and instructions, such as たって　ください。三人の　グループに　なって　ください。、 using rehearsed and some spontaneous language. They ask for assistance and clarification, for example, ～は　何　ですか。十四ページ　ですね。. They pronounce voiced and unvoiced sounds, long vowels, blends, double consonants and high-frequency loan words with developing rhythm and intonation. They read and write texts in hiragana and katakana, with some kanji for numbers, days of the week and high-frequency nouns, adjectives and verbs, such as人、 先生(せんせい)、 日本(にほん)、 大(おお)きい、 小(ちい)さい、 友(とも)だち、 行(い)きます、 食(た)べます. Students identify key points of information in short predictable written, spoken and multimodal texts, understanding descriptions of people, objects, places and activities. They use non-verbal, visual and contextual cues to assist in making meaning. Students use rehearsed language related to their personal world to convey information in both written and spoken texts. They produce short sentences involving nouns, verbs (for example, 何を　しますか 。ゲームを　します。), common counter classifiers (for example, ～人、 ～ひき、 ～さい), and adjective, noun and verb predicates. They apply correct stroke order to all characters, and use appropriate punctuation and textual features in texts such as captions, greeting cards, profiles, emails or timelines. They structure sentences using correct word order, and link information using conjunctions such as そしてandそれから. They translate and interpret short spoken texts, explaining Japanese gestures and expressions that do not readily translate into English, for example, はじめまして、どうぞよろしく。. They adjust their language to suit different contexts and situations, for example, the use of appropriate titles and forms of address, and respond in culturally appropriate ways to interactions with other Japanese speakers, such as bowing when greeting, and using appropriate eye contact.
      Students recognise the nature and roles of the three Japanese scripts, understanding that hiragana represents the basic unit of Japanese sound, kanji represents meaning, and katakana is used for borrowed words. They use the hiragana and katakana chart as a tool when writing and reading, recognising their systematic nature. They know that hiragana and katakana are pronounced identically and that the pronunciation of borrowed words is determined by the Japanese sound system. Students understand and apply grammatical concepts such as the use of particles, for example, の、 へ、 に、 で、 と、 も、 が、 は、 を、 か、 よ、 and conjugation of present, past, positive and negative forms of verbs. They understand and use いand なadjectives, and apply the rules of counter classifiers such as ～人、～月(がつ)、 ～ひき/びき/ぴき. They explain how language and behaviour change according to participants, context and relationship, and that politeness and respect are expressed explicitly in Japanese through greetings, vocabulary, formulaic expressions and actions. They understand that languages and cultures change over time, and provide examples of how languages borrow words from one another. Students make connections and comparisons between elements of the Japanese language and culture and their own, identifying how languages reflect ways of thinking and behaving. They identify how Japanese values such as humility and harmony are reflected in language, such as by deflecting praise, for example, じょうず　ですね。
       いいえ。、 softening responses with expressions such asちょっと or あんまり、 and using indirect forms of refusal or disagreement. 
    "
Japanese,Japanese,,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"
      By the end of Year 10, students use written and spoken Japanese to interact with peers, the teacher and other Japanese speakers to exchange information and opinions about personal interests and experiences. With support they share information about broader topics of interest, such as education, travel, sport, teenage life and popular culture. When collaborating in shared tasks and activities, they use set phrases and modelled language to transact and make arrangements, for example, 来週(らいしゅう)の土曜日にサッカーをしませんか。土曜日はちょっと…。 Students ask and respond to questions, such as どのぐらい、いくつ、 using spontaneous language. They provide explanations, opinions and reasons, for example, by using ～と思います、 ～からです. They maintain and extend interactions by requesting repetition or clarification and by using あいづち. They apply appropriate conventions of pronunciation, rhythm and phrasing in speech to allow for others’ use of あいづち. Students read and write hiragana and known kanji, read katakana, and write familiar katakana words, including elongated vowels, double consonants and contractions. They analyse and extract information from a range of spoken and written texts and multimodal sources. They understand gist and predict the meaning of unfamiliar words and expressions from context, grammatical and vocabulary knowledge. Students create and present informative and imaginative texts, taking into account audience and purpose, such as by using て form (～てはいけません、～てもいいです、 ～ています), and the plain form (～たり～たりします、 ～と思います、～つもり). They extend or qualify their message by using adverbs such as とくに、 時々(ときどき)、 and link ideas by using conjunctions, such as それに、 だから、 けれども. Students translate and interpret texts, explaining words and expressions that are difficult to translate and those with embedded cultural meanings, such as ただいま, おかえり. They describe their reactions to intercultural experiences and reflect on how their own assumptions and identity influence and are influenced by their language use. 
      Students identify the functions of different scripts within texts: how hiragana is used for particles, conjunctions, and verb and adjective endings; katakana for borrowed words and some onomatopoeia; and kanji for nouns and verb and adjective stems. They apply their understanding of kanji to identify word boundaries and know its role in assisting with the identification of linguistic elements. They distinguish between おくりがな and ふりがな、 and recognise that kanji can be pronounced differently using 音 (on) or 訓 (kun) readings. Students understand the function of verb stems, and of て form and plain form verbs, and conjugate a range of verb tenses and forms. They apply their understanding of conjugation to produce negative and past adjectives. Students identify and use a range of case particles such as か (or), より、 で (purpose/by) and に (location). They use metalanguage to describe and compare language features and rules of sentence construction. They choose between using です/ますor plain form based on age, relationship, familiarity, context and text type, such as using plain form in a personal diary. They understand that languages change over time through contact with other languages and cultures, and identify the particular impact of technology and media on contemporary forms of communication, for example, the widespread adoption of English terms into Japanese, such as コピペ. Students explain how Japanese cultural values such as the importance of community, 内(うち)/外(そと)、 respect, and consideration for others are embedded in language and behaviours such as がんばりましょう。 だいじょうぶ？。
    "
Korean,Korean,,Years F–10 Sequence,Foundation to Year 2,"
      By the end of Year 2, students interact with peers and teachers through play- and action-related talk, exchanging greetings and introducing themselves (for example, 안녕하세요?; 안녕?; 저는 ...이에요/예요 used as a set phrase) with gestures. They respond to question cues (such as 뭐예요?) by naming objects with single words (for example, 눈! 코! 입! 고양이!) or using short, simple sentences as set phrases (for example, 눈이에요, 고양이예요). They respond to teacher instructions such as 따라 하세요, 일어나세요 by imitating the teacher’s actions or speech, and to the teacher’s simple closed-ended questions by giving short answers such as 있어요/없어요 or 네/아니요. They make simple requests using … 주세요 and thank each other or the teacher using 고맙습니다 with appropriate gestures. They mimic and approximate Korean pronunciation of simple words, and locate and read specific words such as names of people or objects provided in familiar types of short texts. Students present simple information relating to themselves, their friends or everyday objects, using simple words and set phrases. They create and perform their own simple texts using modelled examples and formulaic language. Students use vocabulary related to their class and home environments. They use the personal pronoun 저, basic particles –은/는, –이/가 and –을/를 as part of formulaic chunks ending with –어/아요 or –이에요/예요 (for example, 저는 고양이가 없어요). They match simple Korean and English texts written in Hangeul and English such as 로버트 and Robert, and identify familiar objects in both languages. Students explain aspects of Korean language and culture in everyday language use, such as ways of greeting and thanking, identify differences or similarities to their own language/s and culture/s, and discuss the experience of learning and using the Korean language.
      Students discriminate Korean sounds and script from those of English and other languages. They identify the syllable block as the unit of writing and associate individual syllable blocks with their pronunciations. They identify their own names written in Korean using syllable blocks (for example, 로버트, 마크) and pronounce them using Korean sounds. Students identify –요 at the end of a sentence as indicating some polite meaning. They identify 저 as referring to self and 저는 as an equivalent to ‘I’ in a sentence. They choose between –이에요 and –예요 when they construct a sentence using a copula (for example, 재키예요; 마이클이에요). They identify Korean language as the language of Korea and as one of the many languages used in Australia and in the world. Students identify some loan words from other languages and Korean words used in Australia and other countries. Students identify differences and similarities between their own and others’ languages and cultures.
    "
Korean,Korean,,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 3 and 4,"By the end of Year 4, students use Korean to interact in classroom routines, action-related talk and play with teachers and peers. They exchange personal information relating to aspects such as age or interests, using simple questions and short statements as set phrases (for example, 몇 살이에요? 아홉 살이에요; ...이/가 좋아요? 네, 좋아요). They use formulaic language to express rapport with others (for example, 아, 그래요? 나도 좋아요). Students respond to instructions for familiar classroom routines and activities taking required actions (for example, 해 보세요, 들으세요, 읽으세요) and to simple questions (for example, 이게 뭐예요? 누구예요? 몇이에요? 오늘 뭐 해요?) with set phrases ending in –이에요/예요 or -어/아요 (for example, 책상이에요; 벤이에요; 구예요; 학교에 가요). They ask for repetition (for example, 다시 해 주세요) and for a turn to ask a question (for example, 질문 있어요) and negotiate requests using simple language (for example, … 있어요?; 네, 있어요/아니요, 없어요; 빌려 주세요; 여기 있어요). Students identify key words or topics from simple oral, visual and written texts, using cues such as context, graphics, familiar vocabulary and language features to support understanding. They present simple information in texts in different formats and create and perform their own texts with the support of modelled language and other resources. Students approximate the sounds, rhythms and intonations of spoken Korean and write familiar words in Hangeul with some accuracy. They create simple sentences in their speech and writing, using basic case markers (such as –은/는, –이/가, –을/를, –에) and a particle –도 as an inseparable part of a formulaic structure: a noun/pronoun + a case marker/particle (for example, 저는 …, 집에 …, 나도 …). They use common action verbs and descriptive verbs (such as 가다, 일어나다, 듣다, 좋다) as part of formulaic expressions ending in –어/아요 or its honorific form –(으)세요, varying intonation contours for statements, questions (with or without a question word), requests or commands. They ask simple questions about people, objects or numbers, using question words such as 누구/누가, 무엇/뭐 and 몇. They use contractions of demonstrative pronouns and –이 (for example, 이게, 저게 and 그게), as formulaic chunks, and vocabulary related to school (such as 학교, 책, 지우개), home (such as 집, 엄마, 아빠) and sports and leisure activities (such as 방학, 수영, 크리켓). They use vocabulary for major colours (such as 빨간색, 파란색, …) and number expressions, choosing between native Korean and Sino-Korean number systems up to 10 as appropriate, using counters to describe ages (for example, 아홉 살), school years (for example, 사 학년) and numbers of objects (for example, 한 개), animals (for example, 두 마리) or people (for example, 세 명). Students match known Korean words or expressions with their English equivalents and create simple bilingual texts of familiar objects with support. They understand that meaning may change through translation across languages and exemplify words that could be translated differently according to context (such as 집: house/home; … 있어요: I have …/there is (are) …). They identify different social networks they belong to such as clubs or language-speaking communities and compare their past and current intercultural capability with reference to the experience of learning Korean.
Students discriminate between meaningful sounds in Korean which are not distinguished in English or other languages such as /ㄱ/ versus /ㅋ/ versus /ㄲ/ or /ㅐ/ versus /ㅔ/, and associate the pronunciation of simple words with their script. Students differentiate statements from questions according to intonation. They identify simple consonant and vowel letters in Hangeul and combine them to construct a syllable block. They create short texts using syllable blocks combined together to form a word. They apply their understanding of Korean and English having different grammatical systems by using appropriate word order (subject-object-verb) and case–marked formulaic chunks (for example, 저는, 사과를) in simple Korean sentences. They identify differences between Korean and English in some aspects of language use such as naming conventions or ways of addressing people. They apply their understanding of the importance of politeness in using Korean and select the appropriate form of language to acknowledge age and social relationships when greeting (for example, 안녕? versus 안녕하세요?; 안녕히 가세요/안녕히 계세요 versus 잘 가/잘 있어). They identify aspects of language use in both Korean and English that people from other cultures might or might not regard as appropriate, such as ways of greeting or (not) making eye contact during interactions."
Korean,Korean,,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 5 and 6,"By the end of Year 6, students engage in classroom interactions to carry out collaborative tasks, to exchange information and to express feelings and ideas related to specific contexts, personal interests and daily routines at home and school. They ask and answer questions with appropriate intonation and gestures, changing sounds on syllable boundaries in a word as appropriate (for example, pronouncing words such as 한국어, 같이 and 감사합니다 as 항구거, 가치 and 감사함니다). They use simple structures for a range of functions, including making simple arrangements and conducting simple transactions (for example, 아이스크림 한 개 주세요. 얼마예요? 오천 원이에요), and some complex structures such as –도 되다 and –(으)ㄴ/는 것 같다 as set phrases to ask for permission (for example, 화장실에 가도 돼요?) and to offer their own opinions (for example, 저는 …이/가 맞는/틀린 것 같아요). They use particles such as –(으)로, –하고 and –에서 as part of a set phrase (a noun/pronoun + particle) to indicate instrument (with/in …, for example, 연필로 쓰세요, 한국어로 뭐예요?), accompaniment (together with …, for example, 친구하고 쇼핑했어요) and location (at/in …, for example, 학교에서 공부해요). They describe two events occurring in sequence, such as daily routines, using two sentences with a 그리고 at the beginning of the second sentence or the –고 coordination (for example, 밥을 먹어요. 그리고 운동해요;밥을 먹고 운동해요), and past experiences using a suffix –었/았– (for example, 캔버라에 살았어요). They negate statements (for example, 안 가요, 못 먹었어요) and construct questions about reasons, prices and opinions/feelings, using set phrases such as 왜요? 얼마예요? and 어때요?/어땠어요? (for example, 영화가 어땠어요?). They use descriptive language (such as 예뻐요, 멋있어요) and manner and time adverbs (such as 빨리, 천천히, 어제, 오늘, 내일). Students describe amounts of familiar items, including currency and time, using number words from either the pure Korean or the Sino-Korean number system in their appropriate forms, with a range of counters (such as 장, 잔, 권, 그루, 송이, 원, and 시) and in appropriate word order (for example, 책 세 권). They pronounce Arabic numerals appropriately according to the accompanying counters (for example, 10살, 6학년). Students locate specific information in a range of familiar spoken, written and digital texts, identifying familiar vocabulary and grammatical features to support understanding. They use simple and formulaic language with the support of structured models and scaffolding to create short texts with familiar structures and features, in various modes and formats. Students translate texts between Korean and English in familiar formats, and create their own simple bilingual texts, using known words and expressions. They provide extra information or explanations for words or expressions that have no equivalents in the other language or cannot be readily translated, such as 벼 versus ‘rice as a crop’, 쌀 versus ‘rice as raw grains’ and 밥 versus ‘cooked rice or meals’. They identify aspects of Korean language in which Korean culture is embedded, such as politeness embedded in –(으)세요.
Students differentiate between spoken and written forms of Korean by applying their understanding of rules that govern pronunciation and writing using Hangeul syllable blocks, and by associating spoken forms of known words with their written forms. They change verb forms using suffixes such as –었/았– and –고 by applying their understanding of grammatical elements that affect different grammatical meanings and functions. They identify the topic/subject and the object in simple sentences and explain how word order in Korean is different to English using basic metalinguistic terms such as word order, subject, object and verb. Students identify distinctive features of familiar spoken and written texts in different genres, such as language used at the beginning or closing (for example, …에게/께; …(으)로부터/올림), and relate them to distinctive purposes, intended audiences and social contexts of texts. Students apply their understanding of the importance of context, age and social relationships in language use during interaction, and identify age as particularly important in determining the level of politeness and formality in using Korean (for example, 미안합니다 versus 미안해요 versus 미안해). Students provide examples of how spoken and written forms of language change over time, and explain how Hangeul was initially created and continues to change. They explain how languages borrow words with culture-specific meanings from each other and provide such examples from Korean words borrowed from English and other languages (for example, 피아노, 케밥) and Korean words used in Australia (for example, 비빔밥 (bibimbap), 아리랑 (arirang)). Students provide relevant comments on how language is used to influence people’s perceptions (such as in advertisements or campaigns), and identify their own ways of thinking about Korean associations such as brand names or names of cultural items. They compare gestures or body languages involved in communication using Korean and other languages and identify similarities and differences across cultures. They provide examples where direct translation is not possible, such as terms or expressions that reflect cultural practices (for example, 잘 먹겠습니다/잘 먹었습니다, 식은 죽 먹기), and determine whether their equivalents exist in their own language/s."
Korean,Korean,,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 7 and 8,"
      By the end of Year 8, students use written and spoken Korean to interact with teachers, peers and others, and to exchange ideas, experiences and interests. They pronounce polysyllabic words that involve syllable-final consonants (받침) such as 먹고, 어떻게 and 축하합니다 as 먹꼬, 어떠케 and 추카함니다, applying relevant pronunciation rules with some accuracy. When interacting, they initiate conversations (for example, 지금 뭐 해요? 어디 가요?), and ask and respond to questions (for example, 왜 한국어를 배워요? 방학 때 뭐 할 거예요?). Students clarify answers or instructions (for example, 무슨 뜻이에요? 다시 말해 주세요) and ask for and give opinions (for example, 어떻게 생각해요?; 제 생각에는…; …인 것 같아요). They describe plans (for example, 한국에 갈 거예요) and ask for suggestions (for example, 무엇을 할까요?). They locate and evaluate factual information in texts and create informative and imaginative texts in a range of modes using multimodal or conventional formats. Students explain reasons for actions and show contrasts between feelings or facts, using conjunctive suffixes (clausal connectives) such as –어/아서 and –지만 (for example, 소라가 좋아서 한국어를 배웠어요; 모자가 예쁘지만 너무 작아요). They use humble/honorific words or honorific particles such as 진지, 드리다 and –께 appropriately, and use some basic onomatopoeic and mimetic words such as 똑똑 and 콜콜 to create expressive effects and engage the interest of the audience. Students use cohesive devices, for example, conjunctions (such as 그리고, 그래서, 그러나, 그런데, –고, –어/아서, –지만), adverbs of frequency (such as 가끔, 보통, 자주, 언제나), time (such as 벌써, 아직) and direction (such as 쭉, 곧장) and the agreement among honorific elements, at sentence level (for example, 할머니께 꽃을 드려요) and throughout the text by using the informal polite style ending –어/아요. They use a range of case markers and particles such as –의, – (으)로, 와/과, –부터 and –까지 (for example, 소라의 생일, 색연필로, 왼쪽으로, 불고기와 김치, 아침부터 저녁까지) and location nouns attached by –에 to indicate relative locations (for example, 책상 위에 …, 상자 안에 …). Students use some complex structures in verb phrases such as –어/아 주다, –고 있다, –(으)ㄹ 줄 알다, –(으)ㄹ 수 있다 and –어/아 보다 as set phrases. They form questions using a range of question words such as 언제, 어디, 어떻게, 어느 and 무슨, and modify nouns using an adjectival form of a descriptive verb suffixed by –(으)ㄴ (for example, 착한 사람). Students write loan words from English in Hangeul and compare their original pronunciation and how they are pronounced as loan words in Korean (for example, 테니스, 포크). They translate across languages, paraphrasing or annotating words or expressions where equivalence is not possible, such as 정들었어요, 세배 or ‘mufti day’. They recount their reactions to intercultural experiences, describing and reflecting on aspects that do or do not fit with their own sense of identity. 
      Students identify grammatical elements such as case markers, particles, suffixes and verb endings from simple Korean sentences, and compare how grammatical functions of nouns and verbs are determined in Korean and English sentences. They provide examples of the Korean honorific system that works at grammar and word levels (for example, 진지 드세요) and illustrate how politeness and respect are important aspects of Korean language and culture. Students differentiate between oral and written forms of words, and apply spelling conventions and spacing rules in their writing. Students explain how word order in Korean differs from English and use a metalanguage to identify common features such as nouns, verbs, cases and subject–object–verb/subject–verb–object constructions. Students identify and reproduce characteristic grammatical features in familiar texts. They vary their language use and make choices of linguistic features, such as the use of polite forms, according to the context. They provide examples showing that Korean is a language for local, international and virtual communication and that it continuously changes as society and culture change, impacted by globalisation and new technologies. Students explain how cultural values and ideas are embedded in language and communicative behaviours. They give examples from their own language/s and cultural behaviour/s which may be interpreted differently from other cultural perspectives and give such possible interpretations.
    "
Korean,Korean,,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"
      By the end of Year 10, students use written and spoken Korean to communicate with teachers, peers and others in a range of settings and for a range of purposes. They use Korean to access and exchange information on a broad range of social, cultural and environmental issues of interest to young people. They initiate, sustain and extend spoken and written exchanges in interactions and transactions by asking and responding to open-ended questions, eliciting opinions (for example, 어떻게 생각해요?; 어디에서 …–(으)면 좋을까요?), requesting elaboration (for example, 왜 …을/를 좋아해요?; 어떻게 그렇게 되었어요?) and providing their own opinions (for example, 저는 민수가 맞다고 생각해요; 저는 4번이라고 생각했어요) and information when requested. They use non-verbal communication strategies such as facial expressions, gestures, pausing or pitching, and give verbal feedback expressing empathy, down-toning, acknowledging or expressing indirect disagreement using reflective language (such as 그렇지요?; 좋았겠어요; 아마; 글쎄요; 아, 그렇군요; 아닌 것 같은데요; 정말 그럴까요?). They make suggestions in relation to topics of conversation (for example, 여러분도 한번 한국에 가 보세요) and consider options, using a range of suffixes and complex/idiomatic structures indicating the future in verb phrases (such as –겠–, –(으)ㄹ래요, –(으)ㄹ 계획이에요, –(으)ㄹ 거예요, –(으)면 좋을까요?). They make decisions comparing options using ...보다 더 ... and providing reasons for decisions (for example, 기차가 버스보다 더 편리하니까 기차로 가요). Students locate and evaluate information from a range of sources, and analyse, interpret and integrate information from diverse perspectives. They create informative and imaginative texts, using a range of case markers, including honorific forms, particles and verb phrases in complex structures (such as –지 않다/못하다, –(으)ㄹ 뻔하다, –(으)ㄴ/는/(으)ㄹ것 같다, –러 가다), and describing two related ideas or events in different relationships by connecting two clauses in a sentence (for example, 비가 올 것 같으니까 우산을 가져 가세요; 저기에서 노래하는 사람이 누구예요?). They use a range of abstract words, selecting vocabulary suitable for the target audience, purpose and context. They maintain the cohesiveness of the text by keeping consistency in terms of speech level and style and honorific elements, and by using cohesive devices such as conjunctors (such as –(으)니까, –다가, –(으)ㄴ/는데, –(으)면서), conjunctive adverbs (such as 하지만, 그러므로, 그러니까) and ellipsis. Students translate and create bilingual texts across Korean and English, providing and comparing alternative versions, identifying ways to interpret and convey embedded meanings in culture-specific terms or expressions that are language-specific. They compare their intercultural experiences, referencing their current and past senses of identity, views and attitudes in relation to their ways of using language. 
      Students describe how spoken and written Korean vary and are modified according to contexts, audiences and purposes. They exemplify such adjustments (for example, changes to pitch or speed of speech, use of contractions or 반말, choice of vocabulary, and level of politeness and formality), explaining possible reasons for particular adjustments. They describe how languages change and borrow from, build on and blend with each other, giving examples in relation to Korean and languages such as English, Chinese and Japanese that share social, cultural and historical relationships. They explain how language influences ways of thinking, views of the world and human relationships. Students use metalanguage to explain aspects of the Korean language such as tense, suffix, honorification, adverb, modification, speech level (for example, 반말, 높임말), and politeness. They assess their own language use and cultural practices from multicultural perspectives and the meaning and impact of multiculturalism from various perspectives. 
    "
Korean,Korean,,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 7 and 8,"
      By the end of Year 8, students use Korean to interact with each other and teachers in classroom routines and activities, exchanging greetings, wishes, experiences, interests and information. They approximate different sounds and intonation patterns of Korean during spoken interaction, and construct and combine Hangeul syllable blocks appropriately to write words and sentences. They greet each other using formulaic language (for example, 안녕하세요?; 만나서 반가워요; 안녕히 가세요/계세요) and exchange basic personal information. They ask and respond to simple questions using an –이에요/예요 or –어/아요 verb ending appropriately (for example, 13살이에요; 이것/저것이 뭐예요?; 뭐 (무엇을) 해요?; 수영해요). They maintain interaction by using formulaic expressions or set phrases to give simple feedback (for example, 알아요/ 몰라요, 네/아니요, 맞아요/틀려요) and to offer their own opinions (for example, 제 생각에는/으로는 ...이/가 맞아요). Students give and follow simple instructions such as 일어나세요, 앉으세요, ..., make simple arrangements (for example, 같이 가요, 언제 만나요?) and engage in transactions such as making and responding to polite requests (for example, 아이스크림 주세요). They negotiate wishes and express possibility or capability using set phrases (such as ...–고 싶어요, ...–(으)ㄹ 수 있어요). Students use familiar vocabulary to describe familiar objects, people, pets, routines and contexts (such as 책, 사과, 빨간색, 아버지, 어머니, 고양이, 월요일, 화요일, ..., 주말, 학교, 집) and appropriate grammatical elements such as basic case markers and particles, for example,  –은/는, –이/가, –을/를, –에, –에서, –하고  and –(으)로  (as an instrumental case particle) in simple sentences. They describe present and past events (for example, 영화가 재미있어요; 영화가 재미있었어요) and express aspects of action or appearance in set phrases (such as ...–고 있어요, ... 같아요). They ask questions using a range of question words, and make negations by using 안/못 for common verbs and by replacing copula ...이에요/예요 with a set phrase ...이/가 아니예요. They describe quality or state (for example, 좋아요, 예뻐요, 재미있어요/재미없어요, 커요/작아요, 맛있어요/맛없어요) and action (for example, 가요, 먹어요, 좋아해요, 공부해요), and use a suffix –었/았– for past events (for example, 갔어요). Students refer to themselves using different forms of first person pronouns (for example, 저, 제, 나, 내, 우리) appropriately and refer to objects using pronouns 이것, 저것 or 그것 according to the context. They use some honorific words and suffixes as part of formulaic expressions (for example, 드세요, 선생님). They express numbers using pure Korean and Sino-Korean number systems, basic counters and Arabic numerals with appropriate pronunciation, in appropriate word order (for example, 사과 한 개, 학생 세 명, 12살, 8 학년). They create texts using modelled sentence structures, formulaic expressions and set phrases. They build text cohesion by using basic qualifying adverbs (such as 아주, 잘, 빨리, 같이), time adverbs (such as 어제, 오늘) and basic conjunctives (such as 그리고, 그러나) and by maintaining consistency in the use of polite verb endings and honorific elements. Students translate texts, predicting meanings by relying on knowledge of their first language, of textual features and of key words, including loan words from English. They create simple bilingual texts in different modes and formats, identifying culture-embedded language such as 우리 used in the context where it means ‘my’ in English (for example, 우리 집, 우리 선생님). They compare their experiences of learning and using Korean, identifying how the experience of learning Korean has broadened their intercultural perspectives and understanding of other cultures.
      Students describe how Korean is used not only in Korea and in the Korean community in Australia but also in the global context. They explain how languages and cultures change through contact by giving examples of Korean words known and used in other languages, loan words in contemporary Korean borrowed from English, and words with similar meanings or pronunciation across languages such as Korean, Chinese, Japanese and some European languages. They demonstrate their understanding of the alphabetic nature of Hangeul by identifying consonant and vowel letters and explaining how to combine them to construct a syllable block and explain how Hangeul was created to correspond to the Korean sound system. Students explain basic features of Korean and English using metalanguage and applying their understanding of rules for writing Hangeul, for pronunciation, for grammar and for text organisation in Korean. They identify how politeness is expressed explicitly and systematically through grammar and vocabulary in Korean and describe how the level of politeness in speech style is determined by the age and social relationships of participants in interactions in Korean. They describe how the spoken and written forms of a language change over time for example, by differentiating between older and modern versions of Hangeul script. They demonstrate their understanding of the close relationship between language and culture by describing how Korean language reflects ways of thinking and behaving associated with Korean people and their lifestyles. They adjust their language use to suit situations and contexts and use non-verbal elements in culturally appropriate ways when using Korean.

Korean,Korean,,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"By the end of Year 10, students use written and spoken Korean to interact with peers, teachers and other Korean speakers in face-to-face, local and virtual communications. They exchange information and opinions about personal and immediate interests and experiences and about broader topics of interest to young people such as environmental issues, globalisation or technology. They approximate pronunciation of polysyllabic words, making mostly appropriate changes in sounds on syllable boundaries (for example, pronouncing such words as 한국어, 같이, 감사합니다, 먹고 and 어떻게 as 항구거, 가치, 감사함니다, 먹꼬 and 어떠케).They write Hangeul following writing conventions. Students initiate conversations (for example, 지금 뭐 해요? 어디 가요?), and sustain interactions by asking and responding to each other and building on each other’s responses (for example, 주말에 시간 있어요? 네, 토요일 오후에 시간 있어요. 토요일 아침에 뭐 해요? 아홉 시부터 열 두 시까지 운동해요, …). They use appropriate facial expressions and gestures. They express understanding (for example, 알겠어요; 모르겠어요), request clarification (for example, 무슨 뜻이에요? 다시 설명해 주세요), ask for opinions (for example, 어떻게 생각해요?) and provide their own opinions using reflective language as set phrases (for example, 글쎄요, 아마 ..., 제 생각에는 …, …–(으)ㄴ/는 것 같아요). They ask for and make suggestions (for example, 무엇을 할까요? 해 보세요). Students analyse and extract information from different print, digital and multimodal sources, drawing on the context to help comprehension and using their knowledge of vocabulary, grammatical forms and structures relating to time, location, cases, honorifics, basic sentence types and text formats. They create and present informative and imaginative texts in different formats and in different modes, expressing experiences and views for different purposes and audiences. They use a range of particles for various functions and modify a noun using an adjectival form of a descriptive verb suffixed by –(으)ㄴ (for example, 예쁜 꽃). They use some irregular verbs (such as 들어요, 추워요) and verb phrases in complex structures as set phrases to express provision (for example,읽어 주세요), prohibition (for example, 쓰지 마세요), trial (for example, 입어 보세요) and ideas or events relating to the future (for example, 갈 거예요, 할까요?). They express two ideas or events in different relationships using conjunctions such as –어/아서, –고, –(으)면 or –지만 as appropriate to connect clauses. Students make comparisons using –보다 더 … (for example, 오늘이 어제보다 더 추워요) and express time duration using … 때/동안 (for example, 방학 때, 일 년 동안). They express the relative frequency of events using adverbs such as 가끔, 보통, 자주, 언제나 and the relative locations of objects/people using location words (such as 앞, 뒤, 위, 아래, 옆) in a formula: a noun + a location word + 에 (for example, 식탁 위에). They refer to self using either 나 or 저 appropriately according to the context. They use some basic conjunctive adverbs such as 그래서, 그런데, 그렇지만 and 하지만 to establish cohesion in texts. Students translate and create simple bilingual texts across Korean and English, comparing different versions, identifying reasons for different interpretations and ways to retain and convey original meanings in translated texts. They recount their reactions to intercultural experiences and exemplify how their personal experiences and assumptions influence their language use and perspectives.
Students explain how language use is adjusted to different purposes and audiences in different contexts and situations by providing examples from differing spoken and written forms of Korean. They compare situations where it is or is not appropriate to use 반말 and other features of language such as text messaging or colloquial forms of expression in Korean, English or other known languages. They describe how languages change over time and through contact with other languages and cultures by identifying possible examples of such change in Korean and other languages. They relate grammatical elements in Korean such as case markers, particles, suffixes, and verb endings to their grammatical functions by explaining them using metalanguage (case, politeness, honorification, 반말, 높임말, native Korean/Sino-Korean). Students explain how cultural values and ideas are embedded in language use, including their own, and identify how language reflects ways of thinking, views of the world and everyday cultural routines, drawing on examples from Korean, English and other languages."

They respond to the storyline and characters encountered in texts and create and perform simple imaginative texts using familiar language such as, Ο αγαπημένος μου δάσκαλος ... . They use verbs (for example, Έχω, θέλω, είμαι, ήταν, θα είναι), nouns (for example, ο άνθρωπος, η μητέρα, το παιδί), adjectives (for example, καλός, μεγάλος, ωραία) and conjunctions to construct and expand sentences and apply basic rules of spelling and punctuation, such as question marks, capital letters, commas, exclamation marks and speech marks. They translate and interpret simple texts, identifying words that are not easily translated (for example, το φιλότιμο) and create bilingual texts for the classroom and school community. They compare ways of communicating in Greek and English to identify similarities and differences and suggest how culture influences language use. 
      Students identify and reproduce orally and in writing letter clusters, and the digraphs/diphthongs.

They identify Vietnamese sound–letter relationships, the formation of consonants clusters (for example, ch, nh, th, tr, ph), diphthongs (for example, ai, ao, au), triphthongs (for example, oai, ươi), and vowel–consonant combinations such as an, am, ac, at. They compare the structural and language features of Vietnamese and English in personal, informative and imaginative texts, identifying audience and purpose. They describe how language use varies according to setting and context. Students provide examples of how the Vietnamese language has changed over time, identifying Vietnamese words that have emerged through contact with other languages, for example, cà rốt, cà phê, căn-tin. They identify cultural practices that are embedded in language use and communication styles, such as use of the terms dạ/thưa to express politeness and respect.

Vietnamese,Vietnamese,,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"
      By the end of Year 10, students use written and spoken Vietnamese to initiate and sustain interactions with teachers, peers and adults in familiar contexts, for example, Bạn thích nghe loại nhạc nào? Tôi thích nghe nhạc trẻ. Bạn thích ca sĩ và bài hát nào nhất? Tại sao? Tôi thích ca sĩ Lynda Miles vì cô ấy hát hay và nhảy đẹp. Bài hát tôi thích nhất là My Best Moments vì nó giúp tôi thấy vui vẻ và yêu đời. They use modelled and spontaneous language to engage in discussions, seek clarification, offer opinions, compare experiences related to familiar topics (for example, Học tiếng Việt có nhiều lợi ích lắm. Tôi thích đi du lịch ở ngoại quốc hơn là ở trong nước. Đồ ăn ở Việt Nam tươi và ngon nhưng không sạch sẽ bằng ở Úc), and express agreement or disagreement (for example, Bạn nói đúng lắm/Tôi cũng nghĩ vậy. Xin lỗi, tôi không nghĩ vậy/tôi có ý kiến khác với bạn). They interact with others to carry out transactions and to plan and organise social or cultural events by negotiating options, and explaining and justifying opinions, for example, Bạn muốn tổ chức sinh nhật ở nhà hay ở trường? Chúng mình nên tham gia gây quỹ để cứu trợ nạn nhân bão lụt. They apply appropriate pronunciation in spoken Vietnamese, including intonation patterns, tones and pauses. Students analyse information and ideas obtained from diverse sources, comparing and evaluating different perspectives related to common areas of interest and study. They present information and opinions using different text types and modes of presentation appropriate to a variety of audiences and to achieve different purposes. They share their responses to different imaginative texts by expressing preferences and describing key elements such as themes, values, plot, and representations of characters and events. They create imaginative texts for the purpose of self-expression and engagement, using cohesive devices such as conjunctions to communicate, link and extend ideas, and common Vietnamese idioms, proverbs or folk songs for illustration of cultural concepts or aspects. When writing, they use verbs to express modality (for example, nên, cần, phải), direct speech (for example, Ba mẹ nói với tôi: ‘Con nên chăm học’) and indirect speech (for example, Ba mẹ bảo tôi nên chăm học), and apply Vietnamese spelling rules and tone markers to a range of words. They translate and interpret texts using strategies to overcome challenges in translation, such as considering cultural expressions or representations, and explain differences in interpretation. Students create a range of multimodal bilingual resources for the school and local community. They explain the relationship between language, culture and identity, and modify language and behaviours in intercultural interactions to enhance mutual understanding.
      Students infer the meaning of unfamiliar words encountered in a range of familiar contexts by applying knowledge of grammatical elements and vocabulary. They analyse the relationship between cultural representations, language choices, and the audience and purpose of different text types. They identify and analyse linguistic features of Vietnamese in a range of situations, explaining variations due to audience and purpose. They explain the impact of social, cultural and intercultural influences on language, identifying and using Vietnamese words that have emerged from globalisation, migration, popular culture and technology, such as toàn cầu hóa, di dân, định cư, hội nhập, nhạc trẻ, công nghệ thông tin, nhật ký điện tử, nói chuyện qua mạng. They explain ways in which language and culture are interrelated and influence each other.
    "
Auslan,Auslan,First Language Learner Pathway,Years F–10 Sequence,Foundation to Year 2,"By the end of Year 2, students interact with the teaching team, class visitors and each other to share information about themselves, their families, friends, routines, pastimes and experiences. They use fingerspelling or sign names as appropriate and lexical adjectives or size and shape specifiers (SASS) depicting signs (DS) to describe the appearance and characteristics of family members, friends or teachers, for example, POSS1 BROTHER OLD++ TALL SKINNY or POSS3 SISTER FRECKLES. Students recount shared and personal experiences and favourite activities, using plain or indicating verbs that are modified, such as PRO1 GO-TO-right, PLAY-continuous, RETURN-left, or LAST-WEEK PRO1-plural VISIT NANNA. They sequence events correctly using time markers such as YESTERDAY, LAST-YEAR, TWO-DAYS-AGO. They use everyday social exchanges such as greeting, thanking and apologising, and express feelings through the use of NMFs and lexical signs. They compare likes, dislikes and preferences, for example, PRO1 LIKE APPLE DON&rsquo;T-LIKE ORANGE. They use appropriate NMFs to ask and respond to a range of wh- questions and yes/no questions. They indicate agreement/disagreement or understanding/lack of understanding by using other NMFs. They follow directions for class routines, for example, PLEASE DS:line-up-facing-front, and give and follow instructions of two or more steps, using directional terms or DSs such as DS:turn-left T-JUNCTION DS:turn-right. Students follow culturally appropriate protocols, such as responding to and using attention-gaining strategies such as flashing lights, waving or tapping a shoulder or table, using voice-off while signing, and observing appropriate distance between signers. They recall and retell specific points of information from texts such as class messages, directions, introductions and &lsquo;visual vernacular&rsquo; descriptions, and they recognise familiar fingerspelled words. They follow procedural texts involving several steps and retell them using list buoys. They view short Auslan stories and respond by identifying and comparing favourite elements, characters and events. They use features of constructed action (CA) such as shifting eye gaze, or head or body&ndash;head orientation when creating imagined texts, and use NMFs to modify manner or intensify adjectives, such as REMEMBER PRO1 JUMP-really-far-and-high. They identify themselves as members of different groups and describe their relationships with deaf, hard of hearing and hearing children, family members, and the community. They identify similarities and differences between how people interact and share stories in Auslan and in spoken languages.
Students know that Auslan is a language in its own right, different from mime and gestures used in spoken languages. They know that eye contact is necessary for effective communication and that meaning is communicated visually through the use of signs, fingerspelling, NMFs and non-conventional gestures. They recognise and describe the main elements of Auslan signs: handshape, movement and location; and identify and categorise signs according to these. They recognise that some signs link to visual images, for example DRINK, ELEPHANT. Students know that some words, such as proper nouns, are borrowed from English by fingerspelling and mouthing, and that locations or orientations of signs can be modified meaningfully, for example to show who is involved in an event. They recognise that signers can tell with lexical signs or show with DSs and CA, and that clauses include a verb and sometimes nouns. They recognise the importance of facial expression, eye gaze and NMFs in a visual-gestural language and culture."
Auslan,Auslan,First Language Learner Pathway,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 3 and 4,"
      By the end of Year 4, students communicate with each other, the teaching team and others about aspects of their personal worlds, daily routines, preferences and pastimes at school and in the Deaf community. They show aspectual marking on verbs to indicate frequency when communicating about daily routines, for example pro3 tap-shoulder-repeatedly, and use modifications to show manner when describing actions and activities. They initiate and maintain interaction by using discourse markers such as fillers, checking and clarifying their understanding. They contribute to class activities and shared learning tasks that involve transacting, planning and problem-solving, for example, by giving and following directions, LIBRARY IN DS: turn-right  AUSLAN DICTIONARY DS: fat-book  SHELF++ THAT. PLEASE BRING-me, expressing preferences, asking for clarification and using persuasive language PLEASE POPCORN GIVE-me++ BEG? They use appropriate cultural protocols in different situations, for example, to gain the attention of a group, such as flashing lights, waving, multiple tapping or foot stomping in some contexts, waiting for eye contact or pauses in signing and walking between signers without interrupting them. They paraphrase information from a variety of Auslan texts and sources used in school and in the Deaf community. They recall specific points of information and recount main points in correct sequence EVERY MONDAY POSS1 CLASS LIST-BUOY-1 READING LIST-BUOY-2 MATHS LIST-BUOY-3 SWIMMING. They plan, rehearse and deliver short presentations about topics such as cultural activities or events in the Deaf community, with the support of materials such as photos, props, timelines or maps. They take into account the purpose and intended audience of a text. They view imaginative texts such as stories, poems and theatre performances, identifying how signers represent their own or others’ actions through constructed action (CA). They create simple imaginative texts of their own, using CA to represent their own or other people’s actions, thoughts, feelings or attitudes. They create signed class translations, for example, of repeated lines in familiar children’s stories, and simple bilingual texts for the classroom or school community, such as posters or bilingual picture dictionaries. Students identify places that are important to the Deaf community and describe how such places evoke a sense of belonging and pride. They recognise that the single most unifying factor of the community is the use of Auslan; and they describe ways in which Auslan and associated communicative and cultural behaviours are similar to or different from wider community spoken languages and forms of cultural expression.
      Students demonstrate how the formational elements of handshapes and their orientation, movement, location and non-manual features can be arranged in signs, identifying, for example, whether a sign is body anchored or not, or is single, double or two-handed. They know the functions of different pointing signs, such as pronouns, determiners or locatives; and can identify examples of signers using a location to refer to a previous referent. They use metalanguage to talk about Auslan, using terms such as constructed action, depicting signs, indicating verbs, non-manual features, pointing signs and clauses. They recognise variation in how Auslan is used, for example by recognising regional dialects and differences in signing space. They identify different ways that Deaf community members communicate with each other and with members of the wider hearing community, for example, face to face, via technology, social media and interpreters. They know that culture is closely related to language and to identity and that it involves visible and invisible elements.
    "
Auslan,Auslan,First Language Learner Pathway,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 5 and 6,"
      By the end of Year 6, students use Auslan to interact with people for a range of different purposes. They use descriptive and expressive language to share and compare experiences, ideas and opinions, such as THEATRE GOOD, LONG -really, LONG-really. They participate in class discussions and show interest and respect for others, for example by using active watching behaviours, signing clearly, pausing for others to respond, asking pertinent questions, making constructive comments, rephrasing, repeating and linking their own contributions. Students use non-manual features (NMFs) such as eye gaze to gain, hold or finish a turn when communicating in pairs or groups. They provide context for a new participant joining a conversation, PRO1 TALK-OVER MATH TEACHER. They use action-oriented language to make shared arrangements, organise events and complete transactions, negotiating roles, responsibilities and priorities and taking into account the views of others. Students locate, summarise and compare information from a range of sources. They present information on selected issues to inform, alert or persuade people, for example, by creating announcements to inform about an emergency or about a clean-up the environment appeal, or instructions for a computer game. They use a range of connectives to create textual cohesion. They view and compare expressions of Deaf experience through different visual art forms, such as painting, photography or sculpture. They view and respond to different types of creative and imaginative texts, discussing ideas, characters and themes; and they identify how a signer has referred to the same referent in different ways, for example with a lexical noun then with a depicting sign (DS). They create and perform their own short imaginative texts based on a stimulus, concept or theme using space to track a character or location throughout a text. They translate a variety of familiar school and community texts from Auslan to English and vice versa, identifying which words/signs/phrases require interpretation or explanation. They create bilingual texts and resources for their own language learning and to support interactions with non-signing people. They describe their connections with the Deaf community and how these contribute to their sense of identity. They reflect on differences between how signed language and spoken language users may be perceived, for example in relation to different protocols when joining interactions, taking turns, using names, or passing between people who are communicating with each other.
      Students describe a sign’s form in terms of all the elements and how they are put together, including types of NMFs. They recognise when a signer has established a location in space in a text and describe how this was done, for example through the use of points, non-body-anchored signs or fingerspelled words. They distinguish between the three types of DSs and what they represent and how they are used in clauses. They identify and describe how constructed action (CA) can be shown in different ways, for example, through a change in eye gaze, body, or head orientation, and by matching facial expressions and reference to another character. They identify how signers use space to track a referent through a text, for example by pointing back to an established location to refer to a noun or by modifying indicating verbs. They understand different ways that English words are borrowed into Auslan and identify connections between Auslan and other signed languages, for example, BSL, ISL and ASL. They recognise the diversity of Auslan users in the community, including people who are deaf, hard of hearing and hearing people such as CODAs or interpreters. Students recognise how Auslan has been transmitted across generations and describe different ways it has been documented and recorded. Students reflect on the ways culture is differently interpreted by others, for example by identifying how stereotypes about deaf and hearing people influence perceptions.
    "
Auslan,Auslan,First Language Learner Pathway,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 7 and 8,"
      By the end of Year 8, students interact to share ideas and interests and to offer opinions, using compound and complex sentences, for example by using lexical conjunctions as well as non-manual features (NMFs). They participate in discussions and debates, acknowledging others’ opinions and developing and supporting arguments. They collaborate in activities that involve planning, project design and problem-solving, for example, G:WELL RIGHT-YEAH , BUT I WANT ADD COMMENT. They use evaluative language to reflect on learning activities and to provide feedback to others. They follow protocols for interacting with sign language interpreters in various contexts. Students locate, collate, summarise and analyse ideas and information from a variety of sources, such as interviews, documentaries or speeches, and they use such information in new forms. They use primary or secondary signed sources in their research, for example, when exploring significant events in Deaf history. They use specialised language to create texts such as vlogs, advertisements or research-based factual reports designed to convince or persuade others. They analyse elements of different imaginative texts such as poetry, performances, signed stories, skits and sketches, and explain how sign choice, NMFs and the use of different stylistic techniques combine to convey ideas and emotions. They create imaginative and expressive texts that draw from their experience as Auslan users and members of the Deaf community, including metaphorical iconicity to create particular effects and to engage interest. Students translate and interpret unfamiliar texts in Auslan or English and compare their own translations to those of their classmates, considering why there might be differences between them. They create bilingual texts to use in the wider school community. They describe how the concept and the experience of Deafhood and visual ways of being apply to themselves and others. They reflect on how their own ways of communicating may be interpreted when interacting with hearing people, and on their use of different communication strategies and behaviours, such as their use of gesture, facial expression and body language.
      Students know that signs can be iconic in a number of ways, and identify iconic signs that represent a whole object or part of an object. They distinguish between character and observer space, classify verb types according to how they use space, and identify constructed action in a text. They explain the form and function of a range of clause types, including what NMFs are used, for example, questions, topicalisation, negation or conditionals. They identify all the ways a signer refers to the same referent throughout a text to create cohesion. They recognise that Auslan is constantly evolving and changing, for example, by identifying changes to Auslan that reflect changes in social relationships, community attitudes and changing technology. Students reflect on how all ways of language use are influenced by communities’ world views and identities, for example by comparing the cultural concept of Deaf identity with the medical model of deafness.

Auslan,Auslan,First Language Learner Pathway,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"
      By the end of Year 10, students exchange information, ideas and opinions on a broad range of social, environmental, educational and community issues. They summarise and justify points of view and use reflective language to respond to others’ opinions and perspectives, for example, RIGHT-YEAH, PRO2 DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE NEVER THOUGHT. They initiate, sustain, support and extend discussion, using strategies such as paraphrasing, inviting opinions and elaborating responses, for example PRO2 CONFUSE PRO1 WIND-BACK. They select appropriate vocabulary and use supporting evidence when clarifying and justifying statements. They use respectful language to negotiate, problem-solve and to manage different perspectives when engaging in collaborative tasks, for example, PRO1 FEEL PRO2 RIGHT TALK OVER…. BECAUSE…. Students research, analyse and evaluate information from a range of sources and perspectives, and create sustained signed texts designed to entertain, inform, persuade or inspire different audiences. They use non-manual prosodic features to create emphasis or other effects. Students analyse different types of creative and performative texts, considering how specific techniques and modalities are used to different effect, for example, using repetition of handshapes and movement paths of signs to create rhyme, or the use of visual metaphors to convey meaning. They compare responses to texts that present particular values or points of view, for example, Deaf poetry. They create their own imaginative texts such as narratives or poems, combining and switching between types of language, for example, telling with lexical signs or showing with constructed action (CA) or depicting signs (DSs) and frames of spatial reference to indicate character or observer point of view. Students translate and interpret a range of signed texts, comparing their translations and explaining factors that may have influenced their interpretation. They identify the relationship that exists between language, culture and identity and explore how individual and community identity are conveyed through cultural expression and language use. They reflect on the experience of communicating in a visual world and on associated challenges and advantages experienced as deaf people in a hearing world.
      Students identify and describe metaphorical iconicity, for example, love, avoid/resist, and compare this with the use of metaphors in English. They distinguish character or observer frame of reference in a text; between main and subordinate clauses; and demonstrate how the inclusion of CA and DSs impacts on clause structure. They analyse different types of text, such as expository texts, identifying characteristic language elements and features. They investigate variation in the use of Auslan, explaining influences such as geographical location, social groupings and history, educational experience, the age of learners, family background and degree of contact with Signed English or other languages. They make comparisons between the ecologies of Auslan and those of signed languages in other countries, taking into account issues such as language policies and language rights, advocacy, reform and language vitality. They identify factors that help to maintain and strengthen Auslan use, such as intergenerational contact and bilingual school programs. Students know that Auslan plays an important role in the expression and maintenance of Deaf culture and in assuring the rights of deaf people.

They identify specific points of information in signed texts, for example, colours, numbers, size or time. They present factual information about familiar topics, using modelled lexical signs and formulaic constructions. They demonstrate simple procedures using known signs, gestures, objects and list buoys. They recount and sequence events, using familiar signs and visual prompts and time markers such as 3-YEARS-AGO, IN-TWO-WEEKS or LAST NIGHT. They restrict signing to the standard signing space. They view short imaginative and expressive texts, such as poems and stories, demonstrating understanding through drawing, gesture and modelled signs. They create simple imaginative texts and retell wordless animations, using familiar signs, gestures, modelled language and visual supports, modifying NMFs and lexical signs to indicate manner. They translate high-frequency signs/words and expressions in simple texts. Students identify themselves as members of different groups and describe their relationships with deaf, hard of hearing students, family members and the larger Deaf community and also with the wider ‘hearing’ world. They consider how these different relationships contribute to their sense of identity. They identify places that are important to the Deaf community and describe how such places evoke a sense of belonging and pride.

They know that signs can be displaced in space for a range of purposes, such as to show locations or to indicate participants in a verb. They know that signing involves telling, depicting or enacting. Students recognise variation in the use of Auslan, such as regional dialects and differences in signing space. They understand different ways that English words are borrowed into Auslan and how these become lexicalised. They recognise variation in how Auslan is used, for example by recognising regional dialects and differences in signing space and explain the nature of transmission of Auslan. They identify different ways Deaf community members communicate with each other and with members of the wider hearing community; and describe how digital forms of communication, such as social media, SMS/texting and NRS, have improved accessibility for the Deaf community and contribute to the vitality of Auslan.

Auslan,Auslan,First Language Learner Pathway,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"
      By the end of Year 10, students use Auslan to share information, experiences, interests, thoughts and feelings in relation to their personal and immediate worlds. They describe the appearance of people, objects and places using SASS depicting signs and spatial location, for example, HAVE DS: round-oval  DS: located HERE NEXT-TO HAVE BUILDING BIG. THERE. There’s an oval there and next to it is a big building. It’s there. They participate in shared learning activities and experiences that involve planning, transacting and problem-solving, using simple signed statements and asking for repetition and clarification when required. They follow protocols when interacting with each other, with interpreters or Deaf visitors to the classroom, for example, waiting for eye contact or pauses to walk in-between signers engaged in conversation without interrupting them. Students increasingly use conventional Auslan signs or classifier handshapes in depictions and rely less on their idiosyncratic systems. They modify some indicating verbs for non-present referents and use constructed action to represent others in recounts. They make explicit which referent is associated with location, for example, BROTHER THERE HAVE OWN IPAD. They recall and retell specific points of information from texts such as class messages, directions, procedures, introductions and ‘visual vernacular’ descriptions. They create textual cohesion through the use of connectives such as lexical signs NEXT or G:WELL, or non-manual features (NMFs) and pausing. They create bilingual texts such as notices or digital displays and resources for the classroom. They reflect on how their own ways of communicating may be interpreted when interacting with hearing people, and on how they adapt their ways of communicating and behaving when interacting with them.

Auslan,Auslan,Second Language Learner Pathway,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 5 and 6,"By the end of Year 6, students discuss aspects of their daily lives, social activities and school experience and respond to each other&rsquo;s comments. They describe relationships and characteristics of people and objects and express feelings and preferences, for example, POSS1 FRIEND CHANGE OTHER SCHOOL PRO1 SAD. They negotiate with each other to plan, organise and complete learning tasks and activities, using statements such as PRO1 DON&rsquo;T-WANT DRAW, PRO1 WANT TAKE-PHOTO, THANKYOU PRO2 EXPLAIN CLEAR, or THAT FIRST IMPORTANT THAT SECOND. They follow more complex instructions and directions involving several steps. They compare experiences, routines, interests and activities, using signs associated with time, sequence and location. They follow protocols when interacting with each other or with interpreters or visitors to the classroom, for example by interrupting conversations appropriately or providing context for a new participant joining a conversation. They paraphrase the content of selected signed texts, such as community announcements, and relay the information to others. They plan, rehearse and deliver short presentations, taking into account context, purpose and audience. They respond to creative and imaginative texts, for example by discussing ideas and characters, shadowing signed elements of theatrical or cinematographic texts that use handshapes, and by making connections with their own experiences. They create or reinterpret simple imaginative texts using elements of constructed action (CA), such as body shift, eye gaze and head orientation change. They modify non-manual features and lexical signs to indicate manner. They translate familiar texts from Auslan to English and vice versa, identifying which words or phrases require interpretation or explanation.
Students discriminate between body-anchored and non-body-anchored signs, and recognise how non-body-anchored signs can modify their locations meaningfully. They know that the function of CA is to represent the words, thoughts or actions of a protagonist in a text, either themselves or others, and that spatial relationships between objects are typically expressed with depicting signs in Auslan. They understand different ways that English words are borrowed into Auslan and identify connections between Auslan and other signed languages, for example, BSL, ISL and ASL. They recognise the diversity of Auslan users in the community, including people who are deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing people such as CODAs or interpreters. Students recognise how Auslan has been transmitted across generations and describe different ways it has been documented and recorded, for example, by glossing and the use of technology such as ELAN.

Auslan,Auslan,Second Language Learner Pathway,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 7 and 8,"
      By the end of Year 8, students use Auslan to interact and to exchange information, experiences, interests and opinions with teachers, peers and others. They initiate and maintain conversations and use strategies such as fingerspelling to replace unknown signs to support continued interaction, such as PRO2 MEAN [FINGERSPELL]? They engage in different processes of collaborative learning, including planning, negotiating, and problem-solving, using familiar and some spontaneous language, for example PRO1 AGREE-NOT, PRO1 THINK DIFFERENT. Students participate in class discussions, explaining and clarifying positions, asking follow-up questions, using non-manual features (NMFs) for topicalisation or negation. They use appropriate protocols to join or leave conversations, for example, waiting for eye gaze or for the signer to finish, not asking for a full recount when arriving mid-conversation, and providing context for a new participant joining a conversation. Students locate, interpret and analyse information from a variety of texts, such as signed announcements, interviews or media reports, using context and familiar language to work out unfamiliar meaning. They demonstrate understanding of different types of signed texts by paraphrasing, summarising and explaining main ideas, key themes or sequences of events. They interpret different types of creative and imaginative texts, such as Deaf performances or expressive art forms, describing and comparing their responses. They plan, draft and present informative and imaginative texts, linking and sequencing ideas using connectives, such as BUT, WHEN or WELL, and strategies such as repetition, stress and pausing for emphasis. They create bilingual texts to use in the wider school community, for example by captioning short stories, poems or interviews with members of the Deaf community. Students reflect on how their own ways of communicating may be interpreted when interacting with deaf people; and they modify elements of their behaviour such as eye contact, facial expression or body language as appropriate.
      Students identify and describe the different types of NMFs, and understand their function and how they interact with clause type. They identify iconic signs and discuss how these match their referents, such as COMPUTER-MOUSE. They understand how handshape and movement represent different things in each type of depicting sign (DS). They identify and categorise instances of signers using spatial modifications to signs and know that signs can be iconic in a number of ways. They analyse clauses to see where signers create composite utterances with elements of constructed action (CA), DSs, points and fully-lexical signs in the same utterance. They recognise that Auslan is constantly evolving and changing, for example, by identifying changes to Auslan that reflect changes in social relationships, community attitudes and changing technology. They understand that the most unifying factor of the Deaf community is the use of Auslan. Students reflect on how all ways of language use are influenced by communities’ world views and identities, for example by comparing the cultural concept of Deaf identity with the medical model of deafness.

Auslan,Auslan,Second Language Learner Pathway,Years F–10 Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"
      By the end of Year 10, students use Auslan to build relationships and to initiate, sustain and extend interactions with teachers, peers and contacts in the wider community. They engage in debate and discuss aspirations and social issues, explaining and justifying positions and elaborating opinions using expressions such as NEVER THOUGHT YEAH-RIGHT. Students use strategies to support discussion, such as self-correction, rephrasing or elaborating if not understood. They use smooth and fluent fingerspelling. They use spontaneous language to participate in activities and learning experiences that involve collaborating, planning, organising, negotiating and taking action. They use modal verbs and non-manual features (NMFs) to express possibility, obligation and ability, such as PRO1 MAYBE SEE THAT MOVIE or PRETEND PRO2 DEAF…. Students use culturally appropriate norms, skills and protocols when engaging with and learning from Deaf people and the Deaf community, for example, waiting to be introduced to new people and knowing how to introduce themselves as second language Auslan learners. They analyse, synthesise and evaluate information from a range of signed sources, summarising key ideas and specified points of information. They predict the meaning of unfamiliar signs and expressions from context and their knowledge of depicting conventions. They compare responses to creative texts such as Deaf poetry, Deaf art and signed narratives. Students demonstrate understanding of Auslan and Deaf culture, for example by preparing and delivering presentations or signed narratives on social and cultural issues, community initiatives and lifestyles. They build cohesion and complexity in texts by using fully-lexical connectives such as IF, THEN and/or NMFs to link clauses. They use constructed action (CA) to show different points of view. Students demonstrate culturally appropriate and ethical behaviour when interpreting and translating texts and consider potential consequences of inaccurate interpreting. They describe how they feel and behave when communicating in a visual world, for example by discussing how the experience fits with their sense of self. They reflect on the role of Auslan in connecting and building Deaf identity.
      Students recognise and explain different ways that signers represent signing space, such as character or observer space. They understand and use depicting signs and CA in complex ways to create composite utterances. They investigate variation in the use of Auslan, explaining influences such as geographical location, social groupings and history, educational experience, the age of learners, family background and degree of contact with Signed English or other languages. They make comparisons between the ecologies of Auslan and those of signed languages in other countries, taking account of issues such as languages policy and rights, advocacy, language reform and language vitality. They identify factors that help to maintain and strengthen the use of Auslan, such as intergenerational contact and bilingual school programs. Students know that Auslan plays an important role in the expression and maintenance of Deaf culture and in assuring the rights of every deaf person.
    "
Auslan,Auslan,Second Language Learner Pathway,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 7 and 8,"By the end of Year 8, students use Auslan to share information, experiences, interests, thoughts and feelings about their personal and immediate worlds. They use modelled constructions, ask for repetition or clarification, such as please slow sign, and use strategies such as fingerspelling to replace unknown signs to support continued interaction. They use lexical signs, gestures and affective non-manual features (NMFs) to indicate understanding, interest or lack of interest, for example, AGREE YES or PRO1 AGREE or PRO1 KNOW WHAT MEAN, BUT&hellip;. They ask and respond to familiar questions and directions and distinguish between statements and questions using grammatical NMFs. Students use familiar language to collaboratively plan and conduct shared events or activities, such as presentations, demonstrations or transactions, for example, PRO2 TYPE PRO1 WRITE. They describe people, animals and objects using lexical adjectives and familiar SASS depicting signs and appropriate classifier handshapes, for example, POSS1 MATH TEACHER TALL DS:long-wavy-hair or SCHOOL UNIFORM HAVE DS:long-thin-tie. They compare routines, interests and leisure activities, using signs for timing and frequency, simple depicting verbs for showing location, and appropriate sequencing. They use culturally appropriate protocols when communicating, such as maintaining eye contact, responding to and gaining attention by waving or tapping a shoulder or table, flashing lights, back-channelling and voice-off. Students locate specific information in a range of signed texts, such as weather reports, public announcements and presentations by visitors, using visual and contextual clues to help make meaning. They summarise and retell key points of information in correct sequence using list buoys. They plan, rehearse and deliver short presentations, taking into account context, purpose and audience and using familiar signs and visual supports, such as photos and props, and cohesive and sequencing devices. Students view and respond to short imaginative and expressive texts, such as short stories, poems and Deaf performances, for example by identifying and discussing ideas, characters and events. They create their own simple imaginative texts and retell wordless animations using familiar signs, gestures, modelled clause structures, high-frequency signs, modifying NMFs and lexical signs to indicate manner. They translate and interpret short texts using Signbank, and give examples of how languages do not always translate directly. They create bilingual texts and resources for the classroom, for example, glossaries and captions for their own and each other&rsquo;s short stories. They explain the importance of facial expression, eye gaze and other NMFs in a visual-gestural language and culture, and reflect on their own cultural identity and ways of communicating in light of their experience of learning Auslan.
Students know that Auslan is a legitimate language, different from mime and gestures used in spoken languages, and that eye contact is necessary for effective communication. They know that meaning is communicated visually through the use of signs, NMFs and gestures and can be expressed through whole signs or fingerspelling. They identify and describe the handshapes, movements and locations of signs. They distinguish between entity, handling or SASS depicting signs by looking at what the handshape and movement represent in each type and know that spatial relationships are typically expressed with entity DSs. They know that signs can be displaced in space for a range of purposes, such as to show locations or show the participants in a verb. They know that signing involves telling, depicting or enacting. They identify iconic signs and discuss how these match their referent, such as HOUSE, TREE, DRINK. They know that the function of constructed action is to represent the words, thoughts or actions of themselves or others. They use metalanguage to talk about Auslan, for example using terms such as depicting signs, indicating verbs, non-manual features, handshapes, pointing signs and clauses. Students recognise variation in the use of Auslan, such as regional dialects and differences in signing space. They understand different ways that English words are borrowed into Auslan and how these become lexicalised. They explore the influence on Auslan of other signed languages, such as BSL, ISL and ASL, as well as English over different periods of time and in different domains of language use, and consider reasons for these influences. They identify different ways that Deaf community members communicate with each other and with members of the wider hearing community, describing how different forms of digital communication such as social media, SMS/texting and NRS have improved accessibility for the Deaf community and contribute to the vitality of the language. Students recognise that Auslan has been transmitted across generations and describe ways it has been documented and recorded. They reflect on ways that culture is differently interpreted by others, for example by identifying how stereotypes about deaf and hearing people influence perceptions; and they understand that the most unifying factor of the Deaf community is the use of Auslan."
Auslan,Auslan,Second Language Learner Pathway,Years 7–10 (Year 7 Entry) Sequence,Years 9 and 10,"By the end of Year 10, students interact with peers, teachers and others using Auslan to communicate about personal interests and broader issues relating to the Deaf community. They participate in class discussions, explaining and clarifying positions, asking follow-up questions, using non-manual features for topicalisation or negation and responding to each other&rsquo;s comments, for example IF DS:place-person DEAF TEACHER MEANS DEAF HEARING STUDENT EQUAL-all. They initiate and sustain interactions; ask for repetition, clarification or confirmation; use more elaborate sentence structures, such as embedding clauses; and use discourse markers such as SURPRISE, INCREDIBLE, WOW or UM. They engage in different processes of collaborative learning, including planning, negotiating and problem-solving, using familiar and some spontaneous language. They follow protocols when interacting with each other or with interpreters or Deaf visitors to the classroom, for example by interrupting conversations appropriately, waiting for eye gaze or for the signer to finish, or by providing context for a new participant joining a conversation. Students locate, interpret and analyse information from a variety of signed texts, such as announcements, news reports and vlogs, using context and knowledge of depicting conventions to work out unfamiliar meaning. They demonstrate understanding by paraphrasing, summarising and explaining main ideas, key themes or sequences of events. They interpret different types of creative and imaginative texts, such as Deaf performances or different expressive art forms, describing and comparing their responses. They plan, draft and present informative and imaginative texts, linking and sequencing ideas using conjunctions such as BUT or IF&hellip; THEN&hellip; as well as joining clauses with NMFs to build cohesion and to extend clauses. With support, they use constructed action (CA) to portray characters in a narrative, modify indicating verbs for non-present referents with increasing accuracy across a text, for example PRO1 ASK-her and use more complex entity depicting signs, for example DS(point):man-walks-slowly. They translate and interpret texts and create bilingual texts and resources to use in the wider school community, comparing different interpretations and making decisions in relation to dealing with instances of non-equivalence. Students explain culturally appropriate and ethical behaviour for interpreting and translating texts, and consider potential consequences of inaccurate interpreting. They reflect on how their own ways of communicating may be interpreted when interacting with deaf people, and modify elements of their behaviour such as the use of eye contact, facial expression or body language as appropriate.
Students identify and describe instances of CA in signed texts and explain how signers use CA and depicting signs in composite utterances. They identify and classify non-manual features in signed texts and describe their function. They know that signs can be iconic in a number of ways, and identify iconic signs that represent a whole object or part of an object. They distinguish between viewer and diagrammatic space, including whether viewer space refers to referents that are present or non-present. Students investigate and analyse the nature of variation in the use of Auslan, explaining influences such as geographical location, social groupings and history, educational experience, age of learners, family background and degree of contact with Signed English or other languages.

They identify markers of their own identity, such as family, school/class and language/s, and compare these to the importance of language, place and family in the formation of identity in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Students identify similarities and differences in the ways they interact when communicating in English and the target language. 
      Students distinguish between the sounds of the target language and English and link sounds to written symbols and conventions. They use simple metalanguage to describe elemental structures of the target language, such as word order and word types. They identify how messages in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages can be communicated in a number of ways, such as Elders’ story-telling or through song, dance and visual design. Students identify kinship terms used for immediate family members and recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have their own personal relationships with place, natural species and phenomena. They identify which stories belong to which natural features, including animals and natural species. They know that different forms of address and kinship terms are used and depend on relationship and context. They identify some words in the language that have been borrowed from other languages. They identify regions, places and communities where the target language is spoken and recognise that there are many different languages spoken in their class, their local community and in Australia. They recognise that language speakers are the most important primary source of language knowledge and that language use reflects where and how people live and what is important to them.

      The achievement standards for the Framework for Aboriginal Languages and Torres Strait Islander Languages Second Language Learner Pathway are generalised in order to cater for the range of languages that may be learnt as an L2 in the school context. The achievement standards will need to be adapted for use for specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages.
      By the end of Year 6, students share information about aspects of their personal worlds, such as their family and friends, interests, everyday routines and experiences, using familiar language and modelled sentence patterns. They interact appropriately with Elders and community speakers, and apply principles and protocols of cultural safety when engaging with cultural material such as artefacts, works of art, texts and performances. When interacting in the classroom, they ask and respond to questions, request help, repetition or clarification, and respond to requests and instructions. Students locate key points of information and messages in a range of spoken, written, visual and multi-modal sources associated with the target language region, community and culture. They demonstrate their understanding of the language region, community and culture, for example, by labelling, organising and classifying natural objects, plants and animals from the environment, identifying and describing key features and landforms, seasonal characteristics, and aspects of traditional and contemporary ways of life. Students view, read and listen to stories, songs, dances and artistic traditions, and demonstrate understanding, for example, by describing characters and events, creating timelines, explaining iconographies and identifying key messages, comparing these to messages conveyed by stories in their own cultures. They recognise that ownership of songs, stories, dances and designs is determined by kinship and other social groupings. They know that song and story carry Indigenous knowledge in the context of Country/Place and family. Students use simple and formulaic language, with the support of structured models, to create short informative and imaginative connected texts in various modes and formats. They translate a range of community texts, such as signs, notices, health charts, posters, relying on key words, and they identify and describe culture-specific concepts and expressions. They create bilingual texts for the classroom and school community that explain target language words and related cultural ideas. They identify markers of identity across cultures and recognise the importance of language, Country/Place and culture to the identity and future aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Students reflect on their own cultural identity in light of their experience of learning the language, explaining how their ideas and ways of communicating are influenced by their own cultural backgrounds. 
      Students know that the target language has its own pronunciation, spelling and grammar, and they apply this knowledge to predict the sound, spelling and meaning of new words and expressions. They use metalanguage for language explanation, for making comparisons with English forms, and for reflecting on the experience of learning the target language and culture. They identify the distinct purpose, language features and conventions of texts such as stories, paintings, songs and dances. Students demonstrate understanding of core elements of the kinship system and its role in social behaviour, by identifying and explaining kin terms, recognising that everyone belongs to certain types of sub-groups and recognising that interactions are patterned by these structures. Students know that language use must be adjusted to suit different contexts, situations and relationships. They provide examples of how languages change over time by identifying words and phrases borrowed from English and other languages, including words that are similar to or borrowed from neighbouring Indigenous languages. Students recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are in various states of maintenance, development and revival and can give some historical reasons for this. They identify connections between identity and cultural values and beliefs, and explain the importance of maintaining and strengthening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages for the particular community involved and for the broader Australian community. They make connections with their own experience when talking about languages and cultures.

The achievement standards will need to be adapted for use for specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages.
By the end of Year 10, students use the target language to initiate, sustain and extend interactions and to express feelings and opinions. They share interests, experiences and aspirations and exchange information about teenage life. They use spontaneous language to participate in activities that involve taking action, collaborating, planning, organising and negotiating. They use culturally appropriate norms, skills and protocols when engaging with and learning from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities. When interacting in the classroom, they make requests, make suggestions and seek clarification. They locate, analyse and summarise factual information from a range of sources on topics and issues related to the target language region. They demonstrate understanding of the target language region, community, culture, way of life and History by presenting information on social and environmental issues, past and present community initiatives, projects and lifestyles. Students listen to, view and share personal responses to a range of texts such as stories, songs, visual and creative arts, films and procedural texts. They demonstrate understanding by identifying and explaining main ideas, key themes, sequences of events, and by comparing the role and representation of animals, people and landscapes. They link and sequence ideas and use expressive language, gestures, artistic and iconographic elements and conventions to create spoken, written and multimodal texts that involve real or imagined contexts and characters. They apply culturally appropriate and ethical behaviour to translate and interpret a range of texts from the target language to English and vice versa, and explain culture-specific concepts, practices and expressions. They create bilingual texts to inform the wider community about aspects of the target language region and culture. Students share experiences and ways of expressing identity, and they reflect on how the target language links the local, regional and national identity of its speakers with the land. They describe how they feel and behave when interacting with target language speakers and resources, and they reflect on how their reactions may reflect their own languages, cultures and perspectives.
Students know the sounds, stress, intonation patterns, writing systems and grammatical elements of the target language and apply this knowledge to construct extended spoken, written and multimodal texts. They use metalanguage to explain sound, writing and grammatical systems, including inflectional and derivational processes. They analyse the form and structure of a range of spoken, written and visual texts and explain their function, form and relationship to social processes, such as declaring identity, acknowledging ancestors and traditional belief systems, and passing on knowledge and information. Students demonstrate their understanding of kinship as a system by explaining its importance in maintaining and regulating social relationships in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and links with Country/Place. They explain how and why language use is adjusted to suit different social and cultural contexts, purposes and relationships. They explain the dynamic nature of language and cultures, and identify factors that influence change, such as contact with other languages or response to new ideas and technologies. Students make comparisons between the ecologies of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and indigenous languages in other countries, in areas such as language policy and rights, language loss, advocacy and reform, and language revival. They identify the role of language in passing on knowledge, and explain how communities&rsquo; worldviews and ways of thinking and behaving shape how language is used. They identify factors that serve to maintain and strengthen language use, such as intergenerational collaboration and transmission, programs and initiatives, and explain challenges associated with such practices and initiatives."
