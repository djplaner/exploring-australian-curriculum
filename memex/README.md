## Memex

Source code exploring how to integrate the Australian Curriculum into [my Memex](https://djplaner.github.io/memex/).

See the [working version](https://djplaner.github.io/memex/sense/Teaching/Curriculum/v9/v9-learning-areas/). Has the foundational v9 Australian Curriculum information about my teaching areas organised into the Memex structure. The intent being that it will become part of my personal knowledge management.
